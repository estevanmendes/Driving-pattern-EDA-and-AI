## Introduction

Acceration and rotation were used to create a model that classifies the driving behaviour in two categories: Normal and Agressive. 

An Exploratory data analysis was done, followed by the delevepment of an AI model using machine learning and deep Learning 

The jupyter notebook outline:

- EDA Training dataset

- EDA Testing dataset

- Data cleaning and preprocessing

- Data Loader

- ML models 

- MLP models

- CNN model following [1] with recurrence plot aproach

- Transfer learning

- RNN models (GRU,LSTM)

- Hyperparams Finetunnig 

Hightlights:

For data filtering was implemented 3 methods was in the data loader, gaussian filter, exponential decay, and rolling average. 

Few signal processing methods were applied in the EDA of each sample.

## Results



## Dataset

The  dataset was retrieved from Kaggle []
